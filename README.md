Welcome to Jonas' CIFAR100 classification repo.
In this repository I implement three neural network architectures based on
the topics covered in CSC 581b: Introduction to Deep Learning in Image Classification at the University of Victoria. I then train these models on images from the CIFAR100 dataset, and tweak their hyperparameters in order to achieve maximal performance.
